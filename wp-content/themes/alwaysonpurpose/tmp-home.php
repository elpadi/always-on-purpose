            	<h1>WHAT DOES 'ALWAYS ON PURPOSE' MEAN?</h1>
                <p>Freedom. Living from a stance of "on purpose" frees you to be who you truly are and what you aspire to be in this world.</p>
                <p>Living "on purpose" gives you the confidence to know that each decision you make is in service to self-actualization and ultimately the greater good.</p>

            	<h1>WHAT CAN THIS PRACTICE DO FOR ME?</h1>
                <p>Imagine the freedom and power in knowing that every decision, every circumstance, and every moment is on purpose. If you can dream of a life where fear does not hold you back from realizing your grandest vision then you're peering into the realm of "on purpose." Living on purpose requires the practice of non-resistant effort and a shift in understanding the difference between what should be and what is. Within this practice, you can learn to live peacefully and confidently in and between the black and white space of life, trusting your direction, and appreciating and enjoying each step of the way. You can free yourself to joyfully experience the life you want.</p>
